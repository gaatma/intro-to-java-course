# Working With Primitives

[![Java Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-OpenJDK-3A75B0.svg?logo=OpenJDK)][1]

The goal of this exercise is to familiarise ourselves with Java:
- primitive types
- and legal and illegal operations on primitive types

## :walking: Decimal Types


### Arithmetic Operations

Following our example of arithmetic operations on integers, create a simple Java program with simple expressions to (for both `float` and `double` types):

- add decimal numbers
- subtract decimal numbers
- multiply decimal numbers
- divide decimal numbers

and print the results on the screen.

### Relational Operations

Following our example of relational operations on integers, create a simple Java program with simple expressions to (for `double`s only):

- compare the equality of decimal numbers
- evaluate which decimal is higher
- evaluate which decimal is smaller

and print the results on the screen.


## :running: Unary Operators - Increment & Decrement

What do the following expressions evaluate to:

```java
int number1 = 12;
int number2 = 12;

System.out.println(number1++);
System.out.println(++number2);
```

Why is that?
